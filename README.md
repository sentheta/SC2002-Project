# SC2002-Project

Consideration:

  Should we make Employee an interface instead of class? NO LOL, need the constructor

  Should we split App to App and DataLoader?

  Should we rename "Person" interface to "User" interface?

  Should we add Branch Enum Status{OPEN, CLOSED}?

Fix to do:

Admin.java: ...

Menu.java: addFood(), deleteFood(), updatePrice(), updateAvail() needs implementation. Take input from user
