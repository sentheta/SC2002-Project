# SC2002-Project

Consideration:

  Should we make Employee an interface instead of class? NO LOL, need the constructor

  Should we split App to App and DataLoader?

  Should we rename "Person" interface to "User" interface?

  Should we add Branch Enum Status{OPEN, CLOSED}?

Fix to do:

Admin.java: ...

Branch.java: make displayOrder() so Staff.java can use it
Order.java: make display() so that Branch.java can use it

Menu.java: addFood(), deleteFood(), updatePrice(), updateAvail() needs implementation. Take input from user
