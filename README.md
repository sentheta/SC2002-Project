# SC2002-Project

Consideration:

  Should we make Employee an interface instead of class? NO LOL, need the constructor

  Should we split App to App and DataLoader?

  Should we rename "Person" interface to "User" interface?

  Should we add Branch Enum Status{OPEN, CLOSED}?

  Should we abolish App.employees ?

Fix to do:

Add try{}catch(Exception e){} everywhere :/

Admin.java: ...

Menu.java: addFood(), deleteFood(), updatePrice(), updateAvail() needs implementation. Take input from user

After everything are done, we will modify private/public/protected/package accordingly
