# SC2002-Project

Consideration:

  JOYFUL: Java Object-oriented Yummy Food Ordering System

  Should we rename "Person" interface to "User" interface?

  Should we make PayMethod an interface instead?


Fix to do:


Add try{}catch(Exception e){} everywhere :/

Always use sc.nextLine() for consistency

Admin.java: ...

After everything are done, we will modify private/public/protected/package accordingly
