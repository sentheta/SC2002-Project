# FOODIE: Flexible Object-Oriented Dining Interface & Environment

TODO

add description attribute and updateDescription() in Food.java

Implement viewReadyToPick() at Customer.java

Add try{}catch(Exception e){} everywhere :/

Always use sc.nextLine() for consistency

Admin.java: ...

Add "package FOODIE" at the start of each file. 

After everything are done, we will modify private/public/protected/package visibility accordingly
