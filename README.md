# SC2002-Project

Consideration:

  Should we make Employee an interface instead of class? NO LOL, need the constructor

  Should we split App to App and DataLoader?

  Should we rename "Person" interface to "User" interface?

Fix to do:

Admin.java: chooseAction() is empty

Add display() to Order.java so that Menu.java can use it
