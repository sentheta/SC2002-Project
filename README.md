# SC2002-Project
# FOODIE: Flexible Object-Oriented Dining Interface & Environment

TODO

Implement viewReadyToPick() at Customer.java

Add "package FOODIE" at the start of each file.

After everything are done, we will modify private/public/protected/package visibility accordingly

GROUND RULES

Add try{}catch(Exception e){} everywhere :/

Always use sc.nextLine() for consistency
